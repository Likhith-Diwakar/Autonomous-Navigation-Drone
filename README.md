# Autonomous-Navigation-Drone

Project Overview
The drone is built using a ZMR 250 carbon fiber quadcopter frame with 250 KV motors, controlled by the Matek F405 HDTE flight controller and operated through the MK32 flight remote and receiver. It features an SIYI A8 Mini camera for real-time vision processing.

Key Features & Objectives
Autonomous Navigation: Uses depth sensing and altitude hold for obstacle avoidance and stable flight.
Sensor Integration: Leverages the SIYI A8 Mini camera for visual data and possibly additional sensors (LiDAR, GPS, or IMU) for precision tracking.
Flight Control & Stability: Configured through Mission Planner for calibration and navigation algorithms.
Potential Applications: Search & rescue, aerial mapping, or AI-driven reconnaissance.
